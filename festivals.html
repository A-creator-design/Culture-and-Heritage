  <h1>Famous Festivals of Arunachal Pradesh</h1>

  <div class="festivals">
    <h2>Losar</h2>
    <img src="../../images/ap/losar.jpg" alt="Losar" width="400">
  <p>
    Losar is the Tibetan New Year festival, widely celebrated in Arunachal Pradesh by the Monpa tribe, especially in areas like Tawang and West Kameng. Marking the beginning of the lunar calendar, it usually falls in February or March. The word "Losar" means "New Year" (Lo = year, Sar = new).

    The festival lasts for several days and is filled with vibrant traditions—cleaning homes to sweep away bad luck, performing ritual dances, hoisting prayer flags, lighting lamps, and offering prayers in monasteries for peace and prosperity. Traditional foods like Khapse (deep-fried pastries) and chang (local barley beer) are shared among family and friends.
    
    Losar is not just a new year celebration—it is a deeply spiritual time that blends Buddhist rituals with joyous community gatherings, symbolizing purification, renewal, and the hope for a prosperous year ahead.

    <h2>Solung</h2>

    <p> 
        Solung is a major agricultural festival celebrated by the Adi tribe of Arunachal Pradesh, usually in the month of September. It is held to seek blessings for a good harvest, prosperity, and protection from natural calamities.

        The festival spans several days and involves rituals, animal sacrifices, community feasting, and traditional Ponung dances performed by women in colorful attire. Sacred chants and prayers are offered to deities like Doying Bote (the goddess of crops) and Kine Nane (goddess of wealth).
        
        Solung is not only a celebration of nature and farming but also a reflection of the Adi people's deep connection to their land, culture, and community spirit.
