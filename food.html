        Thukpa is a traditional noodle soup that is widely enjoyed in Arunachal Pradesh, especially in the colder months. The dish, which originated from Tibet, has become an integral part of the regionâ€™s cuisine. Thukpa is typically made with wheat or rice noodles, and its base is a flavorful broth infused with various herbs and spices. It is often served with vegetables, meat (chicken, pork, or beef), and sometimes eggs, making it a versatile and hearty meal.

        The soup is known for its comforting warmth, especially when consumed during the winter season. The ingredients can vary, but common additions include garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and green chilies, giving the dish a rich, savory, and slightly spicy flavor. Thukpa is not only popular among locals but has also gained recognition across India for its delicious and nutritious qualities, often served with a side of chili paste for those who enjoy extra heat.
