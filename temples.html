It is associated with the legend of Lord Parshuram, the sixth incarnation of Lord Vishnu.

Every year, thousands of devotees visit the site, especially during Makar Sankranti, to take a holy dip in the Kund, believing it purifies their soul. Surrounded by rugged hills and lush forests, Parshuram Kund is not only a spiritual destination but also a spot of serene natural beauty and cultural significance.

    <p>
      Akashiganga is a revered pilgrimage site located in the Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh, known for its scenic beauty and spiritual significance. The name "Akashiganga," meaning "Sky Ganga," comes from the belief that the waters of the river are as sacred as the holy Ganga. According to local legends, it is believed that the water here descended from the heavens, making it a sacred place for bathing and offering prayers.

The main attraction is a waterfall that cascades from a height, creating a breathtaking view as the water plunges into a pool below. Pilgrims and tourists alike visit Akashiganga not only for its natural beauty but also to partake in rituals and take a holy dip in the pristine waters. The site is surrounded by lush forests and the distant Himalayan peaks, providing a tranquil and spiritually enriching experience.
