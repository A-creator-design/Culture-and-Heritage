    <p>
        Located in the Tawang district of Arunachal Pradesh, Tawang Monastery is the largest monastery in India and the second-largest in the world after the Potala Palace in Lhasa. Perched at an altitude of around 10,000 feet, it was founded in the 17th century by Merak Lama Lodre Gyatso and follows the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism. The monastery is home to over 400 monks and houses a massive 8-meter tall golden Buddha statue. Its stunning location, vibrant prayer halls, and ancient manuscripts make it a spiritual and architectural marvel of the Eastern Himalayas.
